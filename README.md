# Using a Proxy to Record Network Traffic of Automated Test Cases

When an automated script fails, you need logs to see what happened. For automating interactions with web applications, we often look for screenshots of the error or videos of the browser to help us understand how we got in the state that caused the failure. Capturing the network traffic of an automation script can also provide hints about how the web application and the web server were interacting in the moments leading up to the failure. In this talk, we see how adding a proxy to the setup can help us capture network traffic as an HTTP Archive (HAR) file and how the proxy can help us understand how the web application reacts to slower network connections by throttling bandwidth.
